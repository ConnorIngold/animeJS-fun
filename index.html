      <h1>Fuck Internet Explorer</h1>
      <h2>Why all web developer should stop developing for the IE.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-wrapper">
      <p id="t">
        For some this title seems like a no brainer. There are many who have used browsers such as Chrome and Firefox and cannot
        imagine returning to Internet Explorer (IE) ever again. But it’s not quite so simple for everyone. There are many users
        who do not have the ability to choose the browsers available to them in their workplace or they are using one of the
        many web apps that were built to be used in IE that has never been updated. So this post is for the system administrator
        (and anyone I build a website for) who needs convincing to update the company’s tools, the web app developer who should 
        update their software or maybe even the user who has become complacent with IE.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number one reason you should stop using IE is that it has major security issues. It is far more susceptible to
        hackers looking to discover the security software you are using. Once they know this they can attack your computer
        without you ever knowing.
        
        Microsoft releases bug fixes for IE on a fixed schedule which allows vulnerabilities to remain open for months before
        being addressed. Newer browsers are releasing new updates and security patches as needed and most of the time you are
        not even aware that your browser has been updated. This is because they understand how important your security is when
        browsing the Internet and have made it as simple as possible to keep you protected.
      </p>
      <p>
        In February 2019, Microsoft released a blog titled “The Perils of Using Internet Explorer as Your Default Browser”. The
        author, a Microsoft employee, explains that IE is a “compatibility solution” and that they are not “supporting new web
        standards for it”. This explains why your brand new website does not look as expected in IE. Web developers are building
        and testing on today’s technology. And it’s not just your organization's website, its websites and web apps across the
        internet that you will miss out on if you do not move to a browser that meets today’s standards.
      </p>

      <h2 class="large">'Supporting Internet Explorer is hell'</h2>
      <h3><em>Every web developer for the last million years</em></h3>
      <p id="p5">
        It is not just having to support multiple incompatible browsers (especially the aged IE11), but also avoiding features
        that do not work everywhere, testing with multiple browsers, and making a design look the same.
